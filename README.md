# Mindfulness ðŸŒ¼
I made this API because I wanted to create an online diary where users can write down their thoughts, reflect on them, and look back at them over time. This tool is designed to promote mindfulness and self-reflection, providing a simple yet powerful way to capture moments of thought. Whether for daily journaling or simply writing down thoughts when inspiration strikes, this API serves as a personal mental archive that encourages reflection and growth.

How to use this API:
1. Download the github file.
2. Place it in a designated place where you can find it.
3. Start VScode, and choose the file where you saved the project.
4. Then start a Powershell terminal.
5. Run "pip install flask"
6. Run python app.py
7. Then this will pop up and you can click the link![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/096d2c64-0027-4c24-b14c-62284607a00a)
8. As last, get ready to write down your thoughts or to do list!

Thank you for using my api, and I hope it benefits you!
